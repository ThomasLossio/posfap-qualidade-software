For while, to run this project, you only need to have installed:

- NodeJS version 12.9.1;
- Yarn;
- Eslint, Prettier and EditorConfig extensions on vscode;
- Adonis/Cli installed globalally on your PC.

First, to run the project, you need to run the commando below on your terminal:

```sh
yarn
```

Then, you can run:

```sh
adonis serve --dev
```

To test if it's worked, take a look on localhost:3333 on your browser and look if you receive the following json:

```json
{
  "greeting": "Hello world in JSON"
}
```

If so, it means that worked normally :D.

Now, Let's Code!
